# Disease-prediction-using-ML-SEM-1-
Abstract-
This is our First Semester Project where we have made a website which accepts various healt parameters from the patient and predicts whether the patients have that particular disease or not based on the predictions done by the Machine Learning model.
We have included two diseases in this project Liver Disease and cardiovascular Disease.

Datasets-
Liver Model Dataset - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/indian-liver-patient-records

Cardiovascular Model Dataset - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sulianova/cardiovascular-disease-dataset?resource=download&select=cardio_train.csv

In the above mentioned files, .ipynb files was written with the help of Google Colaboratory

We have used Django Framework for creating the website.
Frontend of the website was done by html and css only.
